For example, one study found that a type of PFA could enter rat skin, but environmental chemist Stuart Harrad countered, stating that rat skin does not directly mimic that of a human. "

                "paragragh": "For each compound, researchers analyzed the amount which crossed the skin barrier, was absorbed within the surface of the skin, and not absorbed. Researchers found that 11 PFAs out of the 17 were able to cross the skin barrier, with ones with 4-7 carbon atoms absorbing more easily. They concluded that there is no certainty that PFAs will enter the bloodstream, but have been able to enter the skin."

When this happens, the cells of the immune system that produce antibodies, called B cells, attack healthy tissue. ",

Using a single infusion of CAR T-cells designed to target B cells (the immune cells responsible for autoimmunity), researchers eliminated or reduced symptoms and disease biomarkers. Additionally, they monitored the patients after the treatment, and none of the lupus patients relapsed for up to two years."

                "paragragh": "This investigational therapy in patients with lupus who have active disease is called CABA-201. CABA-201 is a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T-cell therapy. Patients in the study get their blood drawn and filtered through a machine in a process called apheresis. This process separates platelets or white blood cells, parts of the blood while returning the rest of the blood to the body. This trial isolates the T Cells in the blood, allowing researchers to genetically modify or change them by putting in a “code” to add the CAR. Using this method, researchers can identify, raid, and eliminate the B cells in the patient's body. Once the T cells are changed, they are multiplied to produce the required dose of CABA-201 cells within the body. Once the CABA -201 cells are injected into the patient's body, they attack the B cells, eliminating them and enabling healthy B cells to appear in the body."
