Donanemab acts like a super-efficient garbage truck, picking up and clearing away the trash so that everything can flow smoothly again. It helps the body remove the buildup caused from the amyloid molecules and has shown the most significant results in patients with mild dementia stage of Alzheimer’s Disease."

This process separates platelets or white blood cells, parts of the blood while returning the rest of the blood to the body. This trial isolates the T Cells in the blood, allowing researchers to genetically modify or change them by putting in a “code” to add the CAR. Using this method, researchers can identify, raid, and eliminate the B cells in the patient's body. Once the T cells are changed, they are multiplied to produce the required dose of CABA-201 cells within the body. Once the CABA -201 cells are injected into the patient's body, they attack the B cells, eliminating them and enabling healthy B cells to appear in the body."

Before treatments, patients receive a mobilization medicine to transport blood stem cells to their bloodstream. These cells are collected and are treated using CASGEVY, which makes precise edits on the patient’s stem cells to suppress the gene that stops the production of fetal hemoglobin. Patients, then, receive conditioning chemotherapy to get rid of existing stem cells in their bone marrow to leave space for treated cells. Upon infusion of the modified cells and successful engraftment, the patient is able to produce healthy, red blood cells. While the treatment has risks like unintended gene edits, the CASGEVY treatment showed 93.5% of candidates (29/31 candidates) didn't have severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months upon treatment. Further information about the clinical trial is disclosed on CASGEVY's website which also shows an interactive view of how the treatment works.

                "paragragh": "As consumer and industrial products roll into the market, they are often advertised as completely safe or organic but these statements should be taken with a grain of salt. In the race for ensuring consumer convenience, consumer protection takes a back seat. A noteworthy example of this phenomenon is the incorporation of PFAS, a class of carcinogenic compounds, into household products such as nonstick cookware, stain-resistant carpets and clothing, and firefighting foam. PFAS, or Perflouroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, are known as “forever chemicals” because of their peculiar resistance to degradation. This is caused by PFAS’ strong carbon-fluorine covalent bond; carbon and fluorine’s large electronegativity difference results in their bond expressing partial ionic character and higher bond strength. Further alarming is the fact that, according to a survey by Sapio Research, 80% of consumers are not familiar with “forever chemicals” and the term PFAS, nor are they aware of the health risks of the compounds"

                "paragragh": "Unfortunately, PFAS is widespread and human exposure to the substance is incredibly common since it can be consumed via contaminated water, food, or air. For instance, PFAS can be released from the surface of non-stick pans if cooking at high temperatures. One report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), found PFAS in the blood of 97% of Americans. Presently, PFAS is spreading exponentially after the products it was in are discarded, PFAS inevitably leaks into the environment, contaminating groundwater."

                "paragragh": "Though, not all hope is lost. A University of California in Riverside (UCR) Research Team have discovered that microorganisms of the genus Acetobacterium, common in wastewater environments, can cleave the C-F chemical bonds of PFAS, effectively destroying the substance. However, the bacteria only seemed capable of performing this miracle on unsaturated PFAS compounds with double carbon-carbon bonds. This research is revolutionary because it advances the search for low-cost water treatment options and for new versions of the bacterium-converted enzyme to fight a variety of PFAS compounds. After all, PFAS are part of a group of 15,000 synthetic chemicals, according to a chemicals database maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."
